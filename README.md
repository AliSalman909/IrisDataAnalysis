# IrisDataAnalysis

This is a simple project showing the basics of reading, summarizing and visulaizing a dataset. 

## Files:

- `iris_analysis.py`: Main Python code
- `iris.csv`: Dataset used

## Skills Used:

- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn
- scikit-learn
- data visualization / machine learning

## Summary
This project explores the Iris dataset.

### Tasks performed:
- Loaded the dataset using `pandas`
- Displayed dataset structure using `.shape`, `.columns`, and `.head()`
- Visualized relationships between variables using:
  - Scatter plot (Petal Length vs. Petal Width by Species)
  - Histogram (Sepal Length Distribution)
  - Box Plot (Petal Length by Species)

The goal is to understand:
- How features like petal length and petal width vary across species.
- The distribution and range of flower measurements.
- Potential outliers or distinct patterns in the data.
